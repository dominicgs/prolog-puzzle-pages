Prolog Sudoku Solver
====================

A letter substitution arithmetic problem solver.

This doesn't have any practical use unless the same puzzle appears again, but
I wanted to upload it for educational purposes.

Using letters.pl
----------------
 * Use (SWI Prolog)[http://www.swi-prolog.org] (```apt-get install swi-prolog```)
 * Run ```swipl -l letters.pl```
 * To solve the sample puzzle use ```solve.```

Future Development
------------------
It would be nice for this to solve arbitrary problems.
